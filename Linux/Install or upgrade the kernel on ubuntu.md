#### Search for the kernel you want with this command
```bash
sudo apt search linux-generic
```
**NOTE:** In this example we will go with the `linux-generic-hwe-22.04` kernel

#### Now upgrade the kernel with this command
```bash
sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-22.04
```

#### Now reboot your server/system to apply the new kernel
```bash
sudo reboot now
```
**You are now done have fun with your new kernel :>**
